Added new columns sales and revenue by multipling the quantity of the product purchased by the respective unit price, added an average column for the sales/revenue of products purchased and also added a calculated column for the Marginal profit made in the company over the space of a year and eight months.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
After cleaning the data in excel and making pivot tables for analysis, it was exported to SQL for further analysis and finally to power BI for creation of dashboard. The following were carried out: 
* Descriptive statistics: Excel was used to calculate average sales, total sales and revenue by region and product, providing a summary of sales volume and revenue distribution. SQL queries calculated total sales and revenue for product, total revenue and sales per region, monthly sales and the most purchased products, establishing overview of the dataset. Summary cards in Power BI displayed key metrics such as total revenue, average sales, marginal profit etc, in a visually concise format.
* Data filtering and segmentation: Excel's filtering and pivot tables allowed segmentation by region, product and year, revealing targeted insights. SQL's WHERE and GROUP BY clauses filtered and grouped by region and product, to isolate specific insights. slicers and filters in Power BI allowed segmentations of region, product and year, enabling dynamic drill-down analysis of specific data groups.
* Dashboard creation: Excel's Pivot table enabled structured summaries, allowing for dynamic updates to analyze various sales dimensions. Aggregated data in SQL formed the foundation for dashboards, supporting seamless integration with other tools for detailed analysis. Power BI's interactive dashboards provided a real-time view with slicers for in-depth analysis across customer and product dimensions.

## Data Analysis and Insight Generation
This visualization tells us what the customers patronize the most and how they shop. this reveals to us what they purchase the most and the least and at what time and period they shop most and also the regions with the highest revenue generated.
1. REGIONAL BREAKDOWN : The pie cahrt and bar chart visualization on region revealed the rate and revenue generated by each region. The region with the highest rate and revenue is South with a rate of 44.16% with 928K generated, then the East had 23.13% with 486K generated, the North had 18.42% and 387K generated, and lastly the West had 14.29% and 300K generated. The difference between the South and Other regions is a very huge which means that the other regions are underperforming when it comes to certain products, perhaps due to the stores in those regions not having what the customers are more in-need of in relations to their environment.
   RECOMMENDATION : conduct a targeted marheting campaign focusing more on the most popular products for each region and giving didcounts and promotion to the products that are not-so popular to encourage customers to purchase them. it is also recommended to move the most demanded products of a region to that region to control loss of profit in a region, for example shoes are purchased better in the south bringing more than 500K but in the west, it brings just 30K so brings the more shoes to the south where they are more in demand is good for company profit and customer satisfaction.
2. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE :  The bar and column charts visualization on sales reveal the revenue generated by each product and that certain products perform better. the product with the highest revenue is Shoe which generated 613K, followed by Shirt with 486K, Hat with 316K, Gloves with 297K, Jacket with 208K and finally Socks with 181K with the lowest revenue. this might also be as a result of customer want in relations to environment.
   RECOMMENDATION : Allocate more marketing resources to the high and better-performing products being shoes and shirts and hats and promote them on digital and social channels. the other can be introduced as complementary products to encourage upselling and analyze trend-basd demand spikes to adjust stock levels in advance to prevent profit loss.
 3. SALES TREND OVER TIME : The column and line charts Visualization represent the monthly and quarterly sales repectively. The monthly reveals that febuary has the highest revenue turnover and that september has the lowest revenue turnover. the charts also reveals seasonal spikes during seasons such as Winter and Summer and drop-down during spring and autumn, the charts shows a rise during the Winter months(December, january, February) and a fall during the Spring months(March, April, May), then another rise in the Summer months(June, July, August) and finally a fall in the Autumn months(September, October, November), in a way the monthly trend moved like a wave. The quarterly line graph shows that the highest quarter is the first quarter and the lowest is the last quarter and it also moves like a wave.
    RECOMMENDATION : Plan targeted marketing campaigns around peak sales periods to maximize engagement and offer special discounts or promotions during off-peak periods to drive sales and smooth out fluctuations. prepare contingency plans for significant trend fluctuations, and also track trending products to understand customer preferences and develop new and improved versions.

##  CONCLUSION
The analysis of sales data provided valuable insights into trends, product performance and regional breakdown. key findings highlights the importance of understanding sales dynamics over time, optimizing inventory and leveraging targeted marketing strategies. By recognizing seasonal trends and identifing high-performing products and customer segment, the company can make data-driven decisions to enhance sales performance. in conclusion, this project underscores the potential for growth through infermed decision-making.

## Data Analysis and Insight Generation
this Visualization reveals some intriguing patterns and trend from understanding customer behavior, tracking subscription types, and identifying key trends in cancellations and renewals of the various subcription types available in the company.
1. SUBSCRIPTION TREND : Subscription numbers showed fluctuations over time, monnthly, quarterly and yearly. There was a steady flow of revenue monthly until it declined in the month of september, it droped from 6.75 Million in August to 3.37 Million in September. Quarterly, there was a steady trend from the first to the second quarter but by the third quarter it declined from 20 Million to 16 Million and to 10 MIllion by the forth quarter. And finally yearly, from 2022 to 2023 there was a decline from 40 Million to 27 Million. This implies the purchases decline after a period of time.
   RECOMMENDATION : Increase marketing efforts during peak periods to capitalize on natural customer interest. And introduce targeted promotions and membership discounts during slower periods to encourage new sign-ups.
2. TYPE PERFORMANCE : The bar chart reveals that the basic subscription type which accounts for 50% of all subscriptions emerges as the most sort out by the subscribers generating over 17 Million more than preminum and standard and it is also the subscription type with the no cancellation records. This shows that more subscribers appreciate the simplicity and affordability of the basic subscription type than they do the other types.
   RECOMMENDATION : Perform targeted marketing on the benefits of the basic subscription type while making adjustments to the other subscription types. promotions such as discounts and memberships can be very effective in driving the purchase of other subscription types.
3. REGIONAL BREAKDOWN : the Visuals presenting the regions showed two things, the first being that each region had the same amount of revenue generated but with different sales rate with the East having the highest (25.11%) and the North having the lowest (24.90%). the second being that the East unlike every other region where on occations subscribers would cancel their subscriptions, there was no record of cancellations in the East which might be as a result of higher customer engagements or effective local marketing.
   RECOMMENDATION : Strengthen marketing efforts in the other regions, using strategies that have worked in the East region. 
4. AVERAGE SUBSCRIPTION DURATION : The average subscription duration each year is 365 days which implies that the subscribers are satisfied with the services rendered as they renew their  subscriptions yearly on average. 
   RECOMMENDATION : Seeing that the average duration per year is good, implement engagement tatics like surveys and periodic check-ins to keep the subscriber engaged over time.
