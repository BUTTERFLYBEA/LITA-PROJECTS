# CAPSTONE PROJECT

### Abstract 
This project aims at getting insights from the sales performance of a retail store and inducing step to take for the betterment of the company. The analysis covers the sales overview for both 2023 and 2024, regional breakdown, product performance based on the quantity sold, and revenue generated and sales gotten over time (monthly and quarterly).

## Introduction 
In today's competitive market, businesses are constantly looking for ways to optimize and improve their performance and understand customer behaviors and purchases to gain a strategic edge. this project was initiated to address the need for a comprehensive analysis of sales data, enabling the identification of trends and opportunities within various regions. By diving deep into this sales data, this analysis will uncover patterns that inform effective decision-making for pricing, product promotion and resource allocation.

### Objectives
1. TO support the company in making data-driven decisions that will enhance profitability and customer satisfaction
2. The insights derived will ultimately guide to strategies to improve market positioning
3. To identify high potential product
4. To predict and anticipate shifts in customer demand


## DATA INFORMATION
### Data sources
The data used in this project was obtained from the Incubator Hub. It includes detailed records of transactions, customer demographics, product information and regional sales distribution.

### Data Collection
The data used was collected and complied through transaction logging. This ensures that the dataset represents an accurate record of customer interactions and purchasing patterns over a year and eight months.

### Data Characteristics
The dataset includes the following variables:
1. OrderID : Unique identification of each order purchased by the customers
2. CustomerID : Unique identification for each customer
3. Product : Items purchased by the customers
4. Region : 
5. Order Date : Date when the items(products) were purchased
6. Quantity : The amount of items purchased in each transaction
7. Unit Price : The cost price of each item purchased
8. Revenue : The revenue generated when the items were sold
9. Sales : the money gotten when the item were sold
10. Average : The average of sale

### BASIC STATISTICS IN THE DATASET
1. Total Sales: 2.1M
2. Average Sales: 211.8
3. Total Customer: 9921
4. Marginal Profit: 1.8M
5. Total Quantity: 68.5k
6. Total Unit Price: 

## Methodology
#### Data Cleaning
* Removing duplicates
Eliminated duplicated records to ensure Data Quality

* Adding New Columns
Added new columns sales and revenue by multipling the quantity of the product purchased by the respective unit price, added an average column for the sales/revenue of products purchased and also added a calculated column for the Marginal profit made in the company over the space of a year and eight months.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the data in excel and making pivot tables for analysis, it was exported to SQL for further analysis and finally to power BI for creation of dashboard. The following were carried out: 
* Descriptive statistics: Excel was used to calculate average sales, total sales and revenue by region and product, providing a summary of sales volume and revenue distribution. SQL queries calculated total sales and revenue for product, total revenue and sales per region, monthly sales and the most purchased products, establishing overview of the dataset. Summary cards in Power BI displayed key metrics such as total revenue, average sales, marginal profit etc, in a visually concise format.
* Data filtering and segmentation: Excel's filtering and pivot tables allowed segmentation by region, product and year, revealing targeted insights. SQL's WHERE and GROUP BY clauses filtered and grouped by region and product, to isolate specific insights. slicers and filters in Power BI allowed segmentations of region, product and year, enabling dynamic drill-down analysis of specific data groups.
* Dashboard creation: Excel's Pivot table enabled structured summaries, allowing for dynamic updates to analyze various sales dimensions. Aggregated data in SQL formed the foundation for dashboards, supporting seamless integration with other tools for detailed analysis. Power BI's interactive dashboards provided a real-time view with slicers for in-depth analysis across customer and product dimensions.
